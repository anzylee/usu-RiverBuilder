If one wants to use example inputs, s/he needs to #   delet the '#' at the start of paramenter lines.# - Bankfull depth can either be (A) user-defined or (B) calculated from the Critical Shields Stress and Median Sediment Size.# - Centerline Curvature can either be (A) user-defined or (B) calculate from centerline slope.# - Calculations of banks of channel are based on channel centerline; calculations of levels of valley are based on valley centerline.######################## GUIDELINES ######################### To ensure the program functions correctly, please abide by the following:# - Put each parameter or function in a seperate line.# - When providing an input involving pi, do so in the form of a*pi, where a is a constant. (EX: 2*pi, pi, pi/6, 3+pi)######################################## DOMAIN PARAMETERS (METERS) ######################################### These parameters initial the environment of the river; the follow will be an example input.# The "Smooth" variable prevents sharp turning in centerline by averaging adjacent values.#    Smooth=1 means taking average from 1 left point and 1 right point, so it will be 3 points in#    total (including itself). Smooth=0 means no smooth at all. Whenever piece-wise mask function#    is applied on centerline, at least Smooth=1 is recommended.Datum=500Length=607.38Valley Slope (Sv)=0.00806Smooth=0######################################### CHANNEL PARAMETERS (METERS) ########################################## These parameters controls the inner channel of the river; the follow will be an example input.# Note that if "Inner Channel Depth Minimum" is set to 0, then the depth minimum will be # calculated based on median sediment size and critical shields stress.Inner Channel Lateral Offset Minimum=8.895Inner Channel Depth Minimum=0.131Median Sediment Size (D50)=0Critical Shields Stress (t*50)=0################################### CROSS SECTIONAL SHAPE #################################### These parameters handles the cross-sectional shape of inner channel. # AU = asymmetric U# SU = symmetric U# EN = flat bottom# TZ(n) = triangle, trapezoid, rectangle#	n is the number of edges along the#	trapezoidal base of the cross section#	such that 0 <= n <= Channel XS Points# Triangle: n = 1# Trapezoid: 1 < n < Channel XS Points# Rectangle: n = Channel XS Points # The follow will be an example input.Channel XS Points=21Cross-Sectional Shape=SU#################################### USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS ##################################### a = amplitude# f = frequency# ps = phase shift# w = wavelength# m = elliptic parameter, between 0 and 1, closer to 1, sharper # A mask is like a on and off switch to a periodic function. It should have a #length smaller or equal to length*2, consists of 0 and 1. 1 means applying the#periodic function; while 0 means ignoring.  # Available Functions: # Mask function: MASK=(dist, on/off, dist, off/on, ...)# Sine function: SIN#=(a, f, ps, mask)# Cosine function: COS#=(a, f, ps, mask)# Sin square function: SINSQ#=(a, f, ps, mask)# Cos Square function: COSSQ#=(a, f, ps, mask)# Linear function: LINE#=(slope, y-intercept, mask)# Perlin function: PERLIN#=(a, w, octave, mask)# Cnoidal wave: CNOIDAL#=(a, f, ps, m, mask)# Step wave: STEP#=(a, f, ps, m, mask)# Highly Curved wave: HIGHCURV#=(a, f, ps, p, mask)#			   p - sinuosity we need; typically with any p > 2 #			       will give a good highly curve line# Examples:MASK0=(ALL)SIN1=(24.5, 1, 0, MASK0)################################################ CHANNEL BREAKLINE INPUT PARAMETERS ################################################# As a note, we can have multiple functions or none in each properties.# Meandering Centerline (Mc) Properties# One can only have 0 or 1 HIGHCURV function, but unlimited number of other types of fuctions.# Meandering Centerline Function=HIGHCURV1Meandering Centerline Function=SIN1# Centerline Curvature (Cs) Properties# We do not recomment one providing centerline curvature function, though it is allowed.#Centerline Curvature Function=SIN3# Thalweg Elevation (Zt) Properties# Thalweg Elevation Function=CNOIDAL1# Inner Bank Properties# One doesn't need to specify the width offset here, as that is defined by Inner Channel Lateral Offset Minimum.# Left Inner Bank Function=SIN3# Right Inner Bank Function=SIN3# Left Outer Banks Properties# Number of outer banks is unlimited, though they should followed the format:# (L/R)# Outer Bank XXXXX=XL1 Outer Bank Lateral Offset Minimum=17.44L1 Outer Bank Height Offset=0.9395# L1 Outer Bank Function=SIN3# Right Outer Banks PropertiesR1 Outer Bank Lateral Offset Minimum=17.44R1 Outer Bank Height Offset=0.9395# R1 Outer Bank Function=SIN3################################################ VALLEY BREAKLINE INPUT PARAMETERS ################################################## Valley Centerline Properties# One can only have 0 or 1 HIGHCURV function, but unlimited number of other types of fuctions.#Valley Centerline Function=SIN3# Left Valley Breakline Properties#L1 Valley Breakline Lateral Offset Minimum=10#L1 Valley Breakline Height Offset=20# Right Valley Level Properties#R1 Valley Breakline Lateral Offset Minimum=10#R1 Valley Breakline Height Offset=20# Left Valley Boundary Properties# Note: valley boundary is always parallel to #       valley centerline, so no functions will#       apply to valley boundary. #       Default boundary is 10 offset and 20 height.# Left Valley Boundary Lateral Offset Minimum=10Left Valley Boundary Height Offset=1# Right Valley Boundary PropertiesRight Valley Boundary Height Offset=1########################################### USER REQUIREMENTS ############################################ Inner Channel Average Bankfull Width# Inner Channel Average Bankfull Width= 17.79# Inner Channel Average Bankfull Depth# Inner Channel Average Bankfull Depth=10.5# River Slope#River Slope=0.00806############################################## Bed Element ############################################### Notes on bed elements:#    User can specify unlimited groups of bed elements.#    Bed elements only applied to river inner channel.#    Bed elements can both positive and negative height (boulder and hole respectively).#    Bed elements may higher than bank depending on its height.#    Bed elements are added after the inner channel bed is calculated.#    Bed elements within the same group WILL NOT overlap with each other.#    Bed elements in different groups MAY overlap with each other.#    Bed elements are randomly placed on bed, and will always try to find place fits its size,#        until the designated number is reached or no more place left in the inner channel bed.#    Bed elements have a minimum size of 5, and a maximum size of size_mean+3*size_std.#    Bed elements are randomly generated basing on normal distribution.# BEG - Bed Element Group# num - number of bed elements wanted to added.# size_mean - average size of the bed elements, both width and length. # size_std - standard deviation of the size of bed elements.# height - average height of bed element.

(Not the length on x-axis, but the length on meandering stream)# height - height of the dam; unlike bed elements and bed roughness, this height is a absolute height#		from the chosen centerline point.# thickness - thickness of the dam# CD1=(loc1, height1, thickness1) # CD2=(loc2, height2, thickness2)
