# RiverBuilder <img src="https://github.com/RiverBuilder/RiverBuilder/blob/master/logo.png" width="24">

## Dependencies

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

*These dependencies are already satisfied in GIS, so no worries about them if you are using GIS.*

## Quick Start

The main command to run the script is `python3 -m riverbuilder <inputfile.txt> <outputFolder> <your message>`. 

* `<inputfile.txt>` provides essential parameters for the program to run. Its format is explained in *riverbuilderInput_format.txt* file, and there are plenty of example input files in the `/samples` folder.

* `<outputFolder>` sets the path of script output files. It is optional. If this argument is omitted, program will create a `riverbuilder_output` folder in your current working folder, and store output files there.

* `<your message>` is a message will be added to the output. It is also optional. If `<outputFolder>` is not set, this can't be set.

More explanations can be found in [manual](https://github.com/RiverBuilder/RiverBuilder/blob/master/RiverBuilder_User_Manual_1.0.0_FINAL.pdf).

### In MacOS or Linux

Type the following commands in a terminal.

```
# Download the repository
git clone https://github.com/RiverBuilder/RiverBuilder
cd RiverBuilder

# Install dependencies
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib

# Run the script
python3 -m riverbuilder samples/S1/S1.txt samples/S1/S1 "A simple test sample."
```

And you should see the following screen output.

```
Start Parsing Inputs...
Start Creating River Channel...

It takes 0 seconds to build the channel.
Start Creating Valley...
It takes 0 seconds to build the valley.

Output files are saved to <Path to your folder>/RiverBuilder/samples/S1/S1

### In Windows

1. Download the github folder.
2. Open a terminal and switch to RiverBuilder folder.
3. Run the following command:
```
<YOUR_PATH_TO_PYTHON3>\python.exe -m riverbuilder samples\S1\S1.txt samples\S1\S1 "A simple test sample."
```
4. A similar output should be printed.

## Acknowledgment

The underlying research used to develop River Builder came from a variety of sources, including UC Davis, the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [Hatch project number #CA-D-LAW-7034-H], the Ticho Foundation (unrestricted donation), US Army Corps of Engineers, and Yuba County Water Agency (Award #201016094). Dr. Rocko Brown and Dr. Greg Pasternack also contributed their own resources in developing different aspects of the underlying research. We thank postdoctoral scholars Dr. Colin Byrne and Dr. Sebastian Schwindt for conversations about various aspects of this version of the software as we were developing it. Other members of the Pasternack lab group gave input from time to time during 2019 and 2020.
