From Xavier's analysis of baseflow Zd, it looks like the "power method" performed best at matching the overall pool-riffle morphology in terms of total amplitude. This is the one with 8 harmonics.

Similarly, the power method worked best for baseflow W series. Has 38 harmonics



For the bankfull flow W series, because it has a trend, it isn't as good, but the power method is still quite good.
