## Usage Information ##
#######################

# This input is intended to be used for riverbuilder1.0.0.

# To use this input, call the following command in a terminal. Make sure the riverbuilder package is in current directory:
#	python3 -m riverbuilder.generators.functionGenerator functionGenerator_format.txt

# If the program runs successfuly (Otherwise, error information will be printed to console, and program will exit), user will get results in three ways:
#   1. All generated functions will be printed to console.
#   2. All generated functions will be saved to a txt file named *steppoolThalwegFunctions.txt*.
#   3. A preview image file *steppoolThalwegPreview.png* will be saved.

# Horizontal length (# need edit)


#########################
## Format Requirements ##
#########################

# 1. All user defined functions should follow the same format as defined in riverbuilderInput_format file.

# 2. Sum of length of steps should not exceed length of reach.

# 3. Reach parameters should be defined before steps.

# 4. Step functions can only do addition; subtraction can be acheived via assigning negative amplitude.

################
## Guidelines ##
################

# 1. Everyline starting with '#' will be ignored.

# 2. Reach parameters:
# 		Length; should be an integer; default is 100
# 		Slope; should be non-negative; deault is 0.
# 		Arbitrary number of user defined functions. Each function should take one line.
#		Meandering Centerline Functions. This follows the same format as it is in 
#			riverbuilder input files. One has to submit these functions if an 
#			unstraight centerline will be used in riverbuilder. 		

# 3. Steps will be built in a sequencial order. Pre-defined steps will be in upper stream than post-defined steps.

# 4. A step definition starts with a 'step starts' line, and ends with a 'step ends' line.

# 5. A very basic step is shown as followed:
#
#    --------------------
#                        \
#                         \
#                          \
#   |---------1---------|-2-|
# 	tread, riser (step <-> tread; riser <-> connector)
#    Part 1 is defined as *tread*, which is regulated by two parameters:
# 				tread length (default value is 10)
# 				tread function (default value is 'flat')
#    Part 2 is defined as *connector*, which connects current tread with following tread. Intuitively, the final tread of a reach will not have a connector. A connector is also regulated by two parameters:
# 				riser height (default is 2)
				riser length (default is 1)
#    A step will also have a *repeat* parameter, which controls the number of repeation of the same step. The default value is 1.
